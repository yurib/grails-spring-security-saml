h1. Spring Security SAML plugin

The Spring Security SAML plugin aims to add SAML support to Spring Security.  It depends on the http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core[Spring Security Core plugin] and
http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-saml/[Spring Security SAML].

Once you have configured a SAML 2.0 IDP server(WSO2, Shibboleth etc) and have configured your Grails application(s) as provider, you can authenticate using SAMl 2.0 protocol.
